Military minded and trained for battle since childhood, Alp Arslan defeated his uncle Qutalmish for the Seljuk throne in 1063, and soon set out west with his eyes on Byzantine lands.\n\n#bold You are assured of your victory against the Romans. But don't let your guard down, for there are many who covet your throne.#!\n\nNote: Defeat the Byzantines for the chance to switch to another legendary Seljuk character who changed the course of History!"

Qawurd took over the governorship of Kirman as his brother ascended the Great Seljuk throne, something Qawurd felt belonged to him. Building up his power base in the region along with his sons, there is no doubt in Qawurd's mind that one day he will have to go against his brother's family to claim what is his by birthright.\n\n#bold To see yourself on the great Seljuk throne, you must be patient. Build up your army, secure alliances and strike when the Emperor is weak or distracted.#!"

 bookmark_karakhanid_desc:0 "Ibrahim ibn Nasr, famously known as Böritigin, was one of the greatest rulers of the Karakhanid Dynasty, which by now was split into the Eastern and Western Khanates. His early military campaigns were spent invading and raiding the Ghaznavids and other local Karakhanid rulers. After a brief stint as a tributary and commander of the Ghaznavid Sultan Maw'dud, Ibrahim declares himself independent and looks to the east...\n\n#bold With years of military experience behind you, can you forge a unified Karakhanid Khanate and restore your family's prestige and honor once again?#!"

Proving to be an exceptional ruler, Ibrahim single-handedly ushered in the Ghaznavid golden age. He soon went on the offensive- subjugating Ghur and deposing its king, and sending his ghazis to plunder the rich land of the Doab.\n\n#bold You have brought upon the Ghaznavid renaissance but your peace with the Seljuks is precarious, and the Hindus will soon look for revenge.#!"

Left with no choice but to pay allegiance to the Turkic conqueror, Muhammad ruled in obscurity at the seat where his family ruled for ages.\n\n#bold Muhammad ibn Abbas isn't all that remarkable. He has average stats, and is a vassal to a very powerful ruler. But he did survive and continue his dynasty, a dynasty which would one day stretch from the Caspian to Bengal.#!"
